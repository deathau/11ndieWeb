Right now I have time to develop game ideas that have been rolling around in my brain for a long time, but I'm not doing that. I have a Tetris-clone which is not perfect, but ready to roll out, but I'm not doing that. Why? Is it simply the tedium of filling in App Store details, or is there something deeper?
